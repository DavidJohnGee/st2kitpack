#### Actions directory

Metadata files go in here that describe actions. Action implementations like a Python file or a shell script also live in here.

In this top level action directory, there are also the 'workflows' and 'chains' directories in which workflows (Mistral) and action-chain implementations are located.

This file may be deleted. It acts only as a descriptor to you, the reader.
